Employee Performance Visualization

Data Visualization with Python · HR Analytics Project
Verification email: 22f3001685@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Python to analyze a synthetic employee performance dataset and create a simple visualization suitable for HR decision-making.

You will generate:

A frequency count of employees in the IT department

A histogram (bar chart) showing department distribution

An HTML file (employee_viz.html) displaying the visualization

A Python script (employee_viz_full.py) that generates the dataset and the plot

This project is part of a data-visualization workflow using LLMs like ChatGPT.

📁 Files Included
File	Description
employee_viz_full.py	Python script that generates dataset, prints IT count, and saves department_distribution.png.
employee_viz.html	HTML page that displays the final visualization.
department_distribution.png	Histogram created by the Python script.
employee_data_sample.csv	CSV containing the generated synthetic employee dataset.
🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed with the following libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Run the Python script
python employee_viz_full.py


This will:

✔ Generate a synthetic 100-employee dataset
✔ Print the frequency count of employees in the IT department
✔ Save the histogram as department_distribution.png
✔ Save the dataset as employee_data_sample.csv

2. View the Visualization

Open:

employee_viz.html


Ensure this file is in the same directory as:

department_distribution.png


If you use GitHub Pages, upload both to your repository’s root or /docs folder.

🌐 Publishing to GitHub Pages

Create a public GitHub repository.

Upload all project files:

employee_viz_full.py

employee_viz.html

department_distribution.png

employee_data_sample.csv

Go to Settings → Pages.

Select branch: main

Select folder: / (root)

Save and wait 10–30 seconds.

Your live site will be available at:

https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/


If submitting to an assignment, use the raw HTML link:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>/main/employee_viz.html

📊 Project Output Example

The Python script prints something like:

Frequency count for the "IT" department: 15


And generates a histogram showing employees per department.

🧩 Customization

You can easily modify:

Number of employees

Department weights

Visualization styles (colors, fonts, annotations)

Dataset schema (add age, gender, performance tiers, etc.)

If you'd like, I can also generate:

✅ A D3.js interactive version
✅ A Vega-Lite live visualization
✅ A Tableau-style color theme
✅ A GitHub Pages landing page (index.html)
